# C++ Module 09 Overview

## Introduction

C++ Module 09 introduces **Containers**, **Iterators**, and **Algorithmic Complexity** through the implementation of specific algorithms. This module is designed to improve your understanding of **Standard Template Library (STL) containers**, custom data structures, and performance considerations in real-world applications.

The project focuses on:
- Understanding and using STL containers effectively.
- Implementing custom data structures.
- Analyzing time complexity and optimizing algorithmic performance.

## Topics Covered

### 1. **STL Containers**
   - **Vectors (`std::vector`)**: Dynamic arrays with efficient random access.
   - **Lists (`std::list`)**: Doubly-linked lists for efficient insertions/deletions.
   - **Deques (`std::deque`)**: Double-ended queues with efficient push/pop operations.
   - **Stacks (`std::stack`)**: Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) container adapter.
   - **Queues (`std::queue`)**: First-In-First-Out (FIFO) container adapter.
   - **Priority Queues (`std::priority_queue`)**: Ordered queue based on priority.
   - **Sets (`std::set`, `std::multiset`)**: Ordered collections with unique elements.
   - **Maps (`std::map`, `std::unordered_map`)**: Key-value pair associative containers.

### 2. **Iterators**
   - **Input Iterators**: Read-only, single-pass iteration.
   - **Output Iterators**: Write-only, single-pass iteration.
   - **Forward Iterators**: Read-write, multi-pass iteration.
   - **Bidirectional Iterators**: Move forward and backward in a container.
   - **Random Access Iterators**: Direct access to any element in constant time.

### 3. **Algorithmic Complexity**
   - **Big O Notation (`O(n)`, `O(log n)`, `O(1)`, etc.)**: Understanding how operations scale with input size.
   - **Sorting Algorithms**:
     - Merge Sort (`O(n log n)`)
     - Quick Sort (`O(n log n)`, worst-case `O(n²)`)
     - Insertion Sort (`O(n²)`, but `O(n)` for nearly sorted data)
   - **Search Algorithms**:
     - Linear Search (`O(n)`)
     - Binary Search (`O(log n)`, requires sorted input)

### 4. **Implementing Custom Data Structures**
   - Writing your own **custom containers** while ensuring iterator compatibility.
   - Implementing **sorting algorithms** with proper time complexity considerations.

### 5. **Performance Considerations**
   - When to use **linked lists vs. vectors** for efficiency.
   - **Choosing the right container** for optimal performance.
   - **Memory overhead and cache locality** when working with large datasets.

## Why Is This Important?

Mastering STL containers and iterators is essential for:
- **Writing efficient C++ programs** that handle large data efficiently.
- **Optimizing performance** by choosing the right data structures.
- **Understanding algorithmic complexity** to improve execution speed.
- **Preparing for coding interviews** where STL knowledge is often tested.

By completing this module, you will have a solid grasp of **C++ data structures**, **iterators**, and **performance optimization**, making your code more efficient and maintainable.
